        Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) sits at a meeting point of ridges, ravines, rivers, and reservoirs.
        If you only look for “tiger habitat”, you’ll miss the real story: a mosaic of dry forests, scrub, grass patches,
        cliffs, and water that together support everything from vultures and otters to mahseer and pangolins.

        <h2>What the land looks like</h2>
        <p>
          The reserve is shaped by the Mukundara hill ranges and surrounding plateaus—rocky slopes, narrow valleys,
          seasonal streams, and broad river corridors. In the dry months, the terrain reads like a map of constraints:
          where water persists, life concentrates; where it disappears, species adapt or move.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Ridges & slopes:</strong> rocky outcrops, shallow soils, hardy vegetation.</li>
          <li><strong>Valleys & nalas:</strong> seasonal drainage lines that become wildlife highways.</li>
          <li><strong>River corridors:</strong> the most biodiversity-dense strips—birds, reptiles, fish, mammals.</li>
          <li><strong>Grass–scrub patches:</strong> often underestimated, but critical for prey and ground birds.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Habitats (the mosaic, not a monolith)</h2>
      <p>
        MHTR isn’t one habitat. It’s a patchwork. That patchwork is the reason you can document everything from
        wetland birds and turtles to dryland larks and antelope. When a site is managed as if it’s “just forest”,
        the patchwork collapses—and biodiversity goes quietly with it.

        <h2>Water shapes everything</h2>
        <p>
          In central India’s dry landscapes, water is the hidden infrastructure. Where water persists, you see
          concentrated tracks, higher bird activity, and a chain reaction across the food web—from insects and fish
          to predators and scavengers.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> streams flow, grasses flush, breeding peaks for many birds and amphibians.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> wetlands host migrants; visibility improves; waterbirds dominate.</li>
          <li><strong>Summer:</strong> pressure test—wildlife funnels to perennial water; conflict risk rises.</li>

          Practical note for visitors and photographers: the “best” season depends on what you’re documenting—not just
          what you want to see.

      <h2>How to explore responsibly</h2>
      <p>
        Landscape appreciation is conservation when it leads to better behavior: stay on approved routes, keep noise
        low, don’t chase sightings, and treat water edges as high-sensitivity zones—especially in summer.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Noise:</strong> if your voice carries, you’re too loud.</li>
        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> long lens ≠ permission to approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste:</strong> carry it back. Always.</li>
        <li><strong>Share wisely:</strong> don’t geotag sensitive spots.</li>
