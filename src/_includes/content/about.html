        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>
          This website is an independent, non-governmental initiative focused on
          sharing readable, source-backed information about Mukundara Hills Tiger
          Reserve (MHTR).
        </p>

        <p>
          The intent is not promotion, tourism, or advocacy for any single outcome,
          but public understanding. Content here is drawn from official documents,
          peer-reviewed research, and long-form studies, and is presented in a way
          that is accessible without oversimplifying ecological or conservation
          realities.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site does not publish sensitive wildlife locations, live movement
          information, or precise spatial data that could place species or habitats
          at risk.

        <p>
          Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve is often discussed through narrow or
          fragmented lenses. This initiative attempts to place landscape,
          biodiversity, and conservation decisions in a broader ecological and
          social context, without noise or sensationalism.
